Startup Profit Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting the profit of a startup based on its R&D Spend, Administration cost, Marketing Spend, and State. The goal is to build an end-to-end machine learning solution that not only trains a model but also deploys it as a usable web application.

What I did in this project:

Loaded and explored the startup dataset

Performed data preprocessing including one-hot encoding and feature scaling

Trained a Decision Tree Regressor to predict profit

Evaluated the model using the R² score

Saved the trained model, scaler, and feature columns for deployment

Built a Streamlit web application to make predictions interactively

Tools and technologies used:

Python

Pandas and NumPy

Scikit-learn

Streamlit

How to run the project:

Install dependencies using requirements.txt

Run the Streamlit app using streamlit run app_streamlit.py

Enter startup details to get the predicted profit

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle, from data preprocessing and model training to deployment, and serves as a practical example of how ML models can be used in real-world applications.
